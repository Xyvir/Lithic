The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon glemas with astral radiance as you strike. The attack deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it is invisible, and the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius and can’t become invisible until the spell ends.&nbsp;
