Lithic is a bespoke Personal Knowledge Management System (PKMS) built on the powerful **TiddlyWiki** engine, re-engineered for a modern academic and engineering workflow. It bridges the gap between the database flexibility of TiddlyWiki and the rapid, outlining experience of **Logseq**.

### The Core Philosophy

* **Logseq-Inspired, Markdown Native:**
    Lithic abandons traditional wikitext in favor of standard **Markdown**. This ensures a frictionless writing experience familiar to Logseq users, keeping your data portable and compatible with industry-standard editors.

* **Academic Rigor:**
    Designed as a digital lab bench, Lithic excels at managing complex project notebooks, typed research, and handwritten notes. It provides a cohesive environment for tracking creative or engineering projects from ideation to documentation.

* **Sane, Print-Ready PDFs:**
    Web-based knowledge bases often fail when physical media is required. Lithic prioritizes "paper-first" CSS, ensuring that your digital notes convert into clean, professional, and sane PDFs for homework submissions, lab reports, and archiving.

* **True Portability:**
    A single-file application that works **100% offline**. It lives on your local machine or thumb drive—no cloud dependency required.
